# What Did We Learn?
- Exploring a dataset can take a long time, and it can be hard to understand AND make sense of the data.
- Implementing machine learning models is intimidating at first, because many things needs to be considered. After making one model for a dataset, it seems straight forward to add more models.
- Working with packages such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, XGBoost, FancyImpute etc. is crucial for modelling and makes the implementation part much easier.
- Python standards and syntax, e.g. documentation, functions, variables and the mix of programming paradigms used.

# What Should We Have Worked More on?
- Model stacking
- Trying more models
- Making the neural network model better
- More thought put into exploring the dataset
